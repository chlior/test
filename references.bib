abstract = {Abstract The ESA mission Rosetta, launched on March 2nd, 2004, carries an instrument suite to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.$\backslash$nThe COmetary Secondary Ion Mass Anaylzer – COSIMA – is one of three cometary dust analyzing instruments onboard Rosetta. COSIMA$\backslash$nis based on the analytic measurement method of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The experiment's goal is in-situ analysis$\backslash$nof the elemental composition (and isotopic composition of key elements) of cometary grains. The chemical characterization$\backslash$nwill include the main organic components, present homologous and functional groups, as well as the mineralogical and petrographical$\backslash$nclassification of the inorganic phases. All this analysis is closely related to the chemistry and history of the early solar$\backslash$nsystem. COSIMA covers a mass range from 1 to 3500 amu with a mass resolution m/$\Delta$m @ 50{\%} of 2000 at mass 100 amu. Cometary dust is collected on special, metal covered, targets, which are handled by a target$\backslash$nmanipulation unit. Once exposed to the cometary dust environment, the collected dust grains are located on the target by a$\backslash$nmicroscopic camera. A pulsed primary indium ion beam (among other entities) releases secondary ions from the dust grains.$\backslash$nThese ions, either positive or negative, are selected and accelerated by electrical fields and travel a well-defined distance$\backslash$nthrough a drift tube and an ion reflector. A microsphere plate with dedicated amplifier is used to detect the ions. The arrival$\backslash$ntimes of the ions are digitized, and the mass spectra of the secondary ions are calculated from these time-of-flight spectra.$\backslash$nThrough the instrument commissioning, COSIMA took the very first SIMS spectra of the targets in space. COSIMA will be the$\backslash$nfirst instrument applying the SIMS technique in-situ to cometary grain analysis as Rosetta approaches the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,$\backslash$nafter a long journey of 10 years, in 2014.},

abstract = {Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) has seen a rapid growth over the last two decades, much owing to the developments in digital camera and solid state laser technologies. PIV can essentially be looked upon as an application of pattern matching principles to experiments. We rely upon hardware such as lasers and cameras for illumination and image capture. Subsequently we use computer code to perform the pattern matching. MatPIV is one of a variety of different computer codes available written specifically for this purpose. The vast majority of codes are commercially available, but in the last 7-8 years several Open Source PIV codes have been created and are currently being more or less actively maintained. MatPIV is one of these codes and it is distributed under the GNU General Public License1 This document acts as the entry level tutorial for using the MatPIV code. Very basic theory is reviewed and references to appropriate sources are included. The focus, however, is on the use of MatPIV and how it is implemented.},

Based on a muti-level optical flow algorithm, the approach has been benchmarked with synthetically generated PIV images, and has been successfully applied to both experimental PIV and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) images. To improve velocity field estimation, new symmetric spline and advection warping methods are proposed together with a data-driven method to impose boundary conditions. To address a historical weakness of optical flow PIV methods, a framework is presented to select the smoothness parameter for experimental images. An analysis of an exper- imental image series with severe blurring and intensity distortions demonstrates the viability of the technique. keywords:},

abstract = {It is pointed out if there are aspects of the turbulence phenomenon which are truly universal, then they should be capable of being characterized in terms of the two parameters $\epsilon$ and $\nu$ which denote the constant rate of dissipation of energy per unit mass and the kinemetic viscosity respectively and these two parameters only without reference either to the mean square velocity 〈u12〉Av or to the size of the largest energy containing eddies. This is a slight modification of Kolmogoroff's similarity principles as currently formulated. It appears that $\chi$=∂$\psi$(r, t)/∂r, where $\psi$(r, t)=1/2〈(u1′-u1′′)2〉Av, and u1′ and u1′′ are the velocities in the x-direction (say) at two points on the x-axis separated by a distance r and at times an interval t apart, can be so specified. The similarity principles require that if this is the case, $\chi$ should be of the form $\chi$≡($\epsilon$3/$\nu$)1/4X(r($\epsilon$/$\nu$3)1/4, t($\epsilon$/$\nu$)1/2), where X is a universal function of the arguments specified. In the limit of zero viscosity, $\chi$ must have the more special form $\chi$→r-1/3$\sigma$(t/r2/3) ($\nu$→0). The boundary conditions on $\sigma$(x) are that $\sigma$=$\sigma$0({\textgreater}0) and d$\sigma$/dx=0 at x=0 and $\sigma$→0 as x→∞. It is shown that with a slight modification of the premises of the theory described in an earlier paper, an equation for $\chi$ can be derived which is compatible with the requirements of the similarity principles as formulated. In particular the ordinary differential equation for $\sigma$ to which the theory leads can be solved. The solution for $\sigma$ which is found satisfies all the boundary conditions of the problem and is unique, apart from adjustable scale factors. The predicted evolutions of $\chi$ and the vorticity correlations are illustrated.},

While there have been several reviews on the topic of liquid crystal thermometry (Moffat in Exp Therm Fluid Sci 3:14–32, 1990; Baughn in Int J Heat Fluid Flow 16:365–375, 1995; Roberts and East in J Spacecr Rockets 33:761–768, 1996; Wozniak et al. in Appl Sci Res 56:145–156, 1996; Behle et al. in Appl Sci Res 56:113–143, 1996; Stasiek in Heat Mass Transf 33:27–39, 1997; Stasiek and Kowalewski in Opto Electron Rev 10:1–10, 2002; Stasiek et al. in Opt Laser Technol 38:243–256, 2006; Smith et al. in Exp Fluids 30:190–201, 2001; Kowalewski et al. in Springer handbook of experimental fluid mechanics, 1st edn.

The recently discovered giant electrorheological (GER) effect breaks the upper bound of the traditional ER effect, but a microscopic explanation is still lacking. By using molecular dynamics to simulate the urea-silicone oil mixture trapped in a nanocontact between two polarizable particles, we demonstrate that the electric field can induce the formation of aligned (urea) dipolar filaments that bridge the two boundaries of the nanoscale confinement. This phenomenon is explainable on the basis of a 3D to 1D crossover in urea molecules' microgeometry, realized through the confinement effect provided by the oil chains. The resulting electrical energy density yields an excellent account of the observed GER yield stress variation as a function of the electric field.},

abstract = {The knowledge about the rheological behavior of electrorheological suspensions in all prevalent conditions is essential for the design process of applications. Of particular importance is the dependence of fluid viscosity on the electric field strength, the temperature, and the shear rate. Previous research has pointed out the difficulties in determining the relevant rheological parameters independent from the geometry and flow conditions. For example, experimental results obtained using a capillary rheometer are different from the results gained in flow channel experiments. Even the results from one flow channel could not easily be used to predict the performance of a channel with, for example, a different distance between the electrodes. Some possible effects such as wall slip, interactions of the particles with the surface of the electrodes, or scale effects based on the particle size distribution in relation to the dimension of the flow channel may complicate the determination of the rheological parameters. To investigate these effects, a flow channel test rig that allows systematic changes to the flow conditions was developed. The distance of the electrodes can continuously be changed from 0.02 to 1 mm with an apparent shear rate from 100 to 10,000 s-1. The electrodes can easily be replaced to determine the influence of surface structure. This article will first discuss the design of the flow channel followed by the experimental results obtained under different test conditions. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the scale effects of electrorheological suspensions in order to develop microfluidic applications.},

abstract = {Microfluidics is a low-cost technique for fast-diagnosis and microsynthesis. Within a decade it might become the foundation of point-of-care and lab-on-a-chip applications. With microfluidic chips, high-throughput sample screening and information processing are made possible. The picoliter droplet runs in microfluidic chips are ideal miniaturized vessels for microdetection and microsynthesis. Meanwhile, individual manipulation of microdroplets remains a challenge: the shortcomings in automatic, reliable, and scalable methods for logic control prevent further integration of microfluidic applications. The giant electrorheological fluid (GERF), which is a kind of ``smart'' colloid, has tunable viscosity under the influence of external electric field. Therefore, GERF is introduced as the active controlling medium, with real-time response in on-chip fluid control. This review article introduces the working principles and fabrication methods of different types of electrorheological fluid, and extensively describes the strategies of GERF-assisted microfluidic controlling schemes.},

Velocity vector fields can be measured with spatial resolutions down to 6.9{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}}6.9{\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}}1.5 {\$}\mu{\$}m. The vector fields are analyzed using a double-frame cross-correlation algorithm. In this technique, the spatial resolution and the accuracy of the velocity measurements is limited by the diffraction limit of the recording optics, noise in the particle image field, and the interaction of the fluid with the finite-sized seed particles. The stochastic influence of Brownian motion plays a significant role in the accuracy of instantaneous velocity measurements. The micro-PIV technique is applied to measure velocities in a Hele--Shaw flow around a 30 {\$}\mu{\$}m (major diameter) elliptical cylinder, with a bulk velocity of approximately 50 {\$}\mu{\$}m{\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}s-1.},

Nearly six decades after their discovery, ER fluids have emerged as materials of increasing scientific fascination and practical importance. This review traces the mechanisms responsible for these fluids' ER response and their attendant theoretical underpinnings. In particular, ER fluids are divided into two different types, dielectric electrorheological (DER) and giant electrorheological (GER), which reflect the underlying electric susceptibility arising from the induced dielectric polarization and the orientational polarization of molecular dipoles, respectively. The formulation of a continuum ER hydrodynamics is described in some detail. As an electric-mechanical interface, ER fluids have broad application potential in electrifying the control of mechanical devices. This review focuses on their applications in microfluidic chips, in which GER fluids have enabled a variety of digitally controlled functionalities.},
