@article{Freyer2015,
abstract = {The knowledge about the rheological behavior of electrorheological suspensions in all prevalent conditions is essential for the design process of applications. Of particular importance is the dependence of fluid viscosity on the electric field strength, the temperature, and the shear rate. Previous research has pointed out the difficulties in determining the relevant rheological parameters independent from the geometry and flow conditions. For example, experimental results obtained using a capillary rheometer are different from the results gained in flow channel experiments. Even the results from one flow channel could not easily be used to predict the performance of a channel with, for example, a different distance between the electrodes. Some possible effects such as wall slip, interactions of the particles with the surface of the electrodes, or scale effects based on the particle size distribution in relation to the dimension of the flow channel may complicate the determination of the rheological parameters. To investigate these effects, a flow channel test rig that allows systematic changes to the flow conditions was developed. The distance of the electrodes can continuously be changed from 0.02 to 1 mm with an apparent shear rate from 100 to 10,000 s-1. The electrodes can easily be replaced to determine the influence of surface structure. This article will first discuss the design of the flow channel followed by the experimental results obtained under different test conditions. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the scale effects of electrorheological suspensions in order to develop microfluidic applications.},

Our understanding and utilization of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are growing at an explosive rate with a worldwide market approaching billions of dollars. In time, microdevices will fill the niches of our lives as pervasively as electronics do right now. But if these miniature devices are to fulfill their mammoth potential, today's engineers need a thorough grounding in the underlying physics, modeling techniques, fabrication methods, and materials of MEMS.The MEMS Handbook delivers all of this and more. Its team of authors-unsurpassed in their experience and standing in the scientific community- explore various aspects of MEMS: their design, fabrication, and applications as well as the physical modeling of their operations. Designed for maximum readability without compromising rigor, it provides a current and essential overview of this fledgling discipline.},

abstract = {Microfluidics is a low-cost technique for fast-diagnosis and microsynthesis. Within a decade it might become the foundation of point-of-care and lab-on-a-chip applications. With microfluidic chips, high-throughput sample screening and information processing are made possible. The picoliter droplet runs in microfluidic chips are ideal miniaturized vessels for microdetection and microsynthesis. Meanwhile, individual manipulation of microdroplets remains a challenge: the shortcomings in automatic, reliable, and scalable methods for logic control prevent further integration of microfluidic applications. The giant electrorheological fluid (GERF), which is a kind of ``smart'' colloid, has tunable viscosity under the influence of external electric field. Therefore, GERF is introduced as the active controlling medium, with real-time response in on-chip fluid control. This review article introduces the working principles and fabrication methods of different types of electrorheological fluid, and extensively describes the strategies of GERF-assisted microfluidic controlling schemes.},

abstract = {Electrorheological (ER) fluids, consisting of solid particles dispersed in an insulating liquid, display the special characteristic of electric-field-induced rheological variations. Nearly six decades after their discovery, ER fluids have emerged as materials of increasing scientific fascination and practical importance. This review traces the mechanisms responsible for these fluids' ER response and their attendant theoretical underpinnings. In particular, ER fluids are divided into two different types, dielectric electrorheological (DER) and giant electrorheological (GER), which reflect the underlying electric susceptibility arising from the induced dielectric polarization and the orientational polarization of molecular dipoles, respectively. The formulation of a continuum ER hydrodynamics is described in some detail. As an electric-mechanical interface, ER fluids have broad application potential in electrifying the control of mechanical devices. This review focuses on their applications in microfluidic chips, in which GER fluids have enabled a variety of digitally controlled functionalities.},
