abstract = {This review discusses the use of the combination of surface roughness and hy-drophobicity for engineering large slip at the fluid-solid interface. These su-perhydrophobic surfaces were initially inspired by the unique water-repellent properties of the lotus leaf and can be employed to produce drag reduction in both laminar and turbulent flows, enhance mixing in laminar flows, and amplify diffusion-osmotic flows. We review the current state of experiments, simulations, and theory of flow past superhydrophobic surfaces. In addition, the designs and limitations of these surfaces are discussed, with an eye toward implementing these surfaces in a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {The knowledge about the rheological behavior of electrorheological suspensions in all prevalent conditions is essential for the design process of applications. Of particular importance is the dependence of fluid viscosity on the electric field strength, the temperature, and the shear rate. Previous research has pointed out the difficulties in determining the relevant rheological parameters independent from the geometry and flow conditions. For example, experimental results obtained using a capillary rheometer are different from the results gained in flow channel experiments. Even the results from one flow channel could not easily be used to predict the performance of a channel with, for example, a different distance between the electrodes. Some possible effects such as wall slip, interactions of the particles with the surface of the electrodes, or scale effects based on the particle size distribution in relation to the dimension of the flow channel may complicate the determination of the rheological parameters. To investigate these effects, a flow channel test rig that allows systematic changes to the flow conditions was developed. The distance of the electrodes can continuously be changed from 0.02 to 1 mm with an apparent shear rate from 100 to 10,000 s-1. The electrodes can easily be replaced to determine the influence of surface structure. This article will first discuss the design of the flow channel followed by the experimental results obtained under different test conditions. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the scale effects of electrorheological suspensions in order to develop microfluidic applications.},

abstract = {Microfluidics is a low-cost technique for fast-diagnosis and microsynthesis. Within a decade it might become the foundation of point-of-care and lab-on-a-chip applications. With microfluidic chips, high-throughput sample screening and information processing are made possible. The picoliter droplet runs in microfluidic chips are ideal miniaturized vessels for microdetection and microsynthesis. Meanwhile, individual manipulation of microdroplets remains a challenge: the shortcomings in automatic, reliable, and scalable methods for logic control prevent further integration of microfluidic applications. The giant electrorheological fluid (GERF), which is a kind of ``smart'' colloid, has tunable viscosity under the influence of external electric field. Therefore, GERF is introduced as the active controlling medium, with real-time response in on-chip fluid control. This review article introduces the working principles and fabrication methods of different types of electrorheological fluid, and extensively describes the strategies of GERF-assisted microfluidic controlling schemes.},

The stochastic influence of Brownian motion plays a significant role in the accuracy of instantaneous velocity measurements.

Nearly six decades after their discovery, ER fluids have emerged as materials of increasing scientific fascination and practical importance. This review traces the mechanisms responsible for these fluids' ER response and their attendant theoretical underpinnings. In particular, ER fluids are divided into two different types, dielectric electrorheological (DER) and giant electrorheological (GER), which reflect the underlying electric susceptibility arising from the induced dielectric polarization and the orientational polarization of molecular dipoles, respectively. The formulation of a continuum ER hydrodynamics is described in some detail. As an electric-mechanical interface, ER fluids have broad application potential in electrifying the control of mechanical devices. This review focuses on their applications in microfluidic chips, in which GER fluids have enabled a variety of digitally controlled functionalities.},

We consider the stability of a FF in terms of various forces and torques on the magnetic particles. We discuss thermodiffusion, which is an important phenomenon in FF and which gives rise to the Soret effect. We also consider the rotational dynamics of the magnetic moments of the particles. A large portion of this review is dedicated to applications of FF, including a few of the many technological applications. Among the uses of a FF in the study of materials, we have selected the doping of liquid crystals. Among the very promising uses in Medicine, we discuss drug targeting, hyperthermia, cell separation, and contrast in magnetic resonance imaging.

In flow mode, the response times of the ER-fluid under various electric field strengths and flow rates were determined from the pressure measurements in channel flow. The response times in flow modewere exponentially decreasedwith the increase of the volumetric flow rate and the electric field strength.
