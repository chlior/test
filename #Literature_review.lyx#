Background

\begin_layout Standard
Electrorheological fluids (ERF) are mixtures of active dipole particles
 with a dielectric fluid.
 The rheological properties of such substances, therefore, change when an
 external electrical field is applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rheology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Rheology branch or physics deals with deformation and flow of matter.
 Among others it focus on the non-Newtonian flow of liquids as well as the
 plastic flow of solids.
 The relationship between the shear stress and the shear strain rate for
 liquids, in simple Newtonian fluid cases turns to be only their viscosity

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Rheological properties of interest in the context of ERF, are the shear
 stress (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

), shear rate or shear strain rate (
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\gamma}$
\end_inset

), dynamic viscosity (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

) and kinematic viscosity (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

The 
\series bold
shear stress
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, N m
\begin_inset Formula $^{-2}$
\end_inset

) is defined as the component of stress coplanar with a material cross section.
 Shear stress arises from the force vector component 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 parallel to the cross section, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau=\frac{F}{A}\label{eq:sheer stress}
\end{equation}

The 
\series bold
shear rate
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\gamma}$
\end_inset

, sec
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

) is commonly defined as the rate of change of velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

, in the component parallel to the applied force, at which one layer of
 fluid passes over an adjacent layer (inter-layer infinitesimal distance
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $dy$
\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\gamma}=\frac{d\gamma}{dt}=\frac{du}{dy}\label{eq:shear rate}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is 
\series bold
shearing strain
\series default
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 is the time change.
 The 
\series bold
dynamic viscosity
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

) is the fluid property that relates shearing stress and fluid motion.
 For Newtonian fluids, the 
\series bold
dynamic viscosity isabsolute viscosity
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

) can be calculated as a linear rate of shear stress to shear rate: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta=\frac{\tau}{\dot{\gamma}}=\frac{\tau}{du/dy}=const.\label{dynamic viscosity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the 
\series bold
kinematic viscosity
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nu=\frac{\eta}{\rho}\label{kinematic viscosity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the density of the liquid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
If the viscosity is influenced by the shear rate, it is important to emphasize
 that, the values are different from the constant ones related to an ideally
 viscous fluid.
 The values obtained are apparent viscosity values.
 They represent one point of the viscosity function only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
For non-Newtonian fluids the shearing stress is not linearly related to
 the rate of shearing strain.
 For simplicity an apparent viscosity is sometimes defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{a}=\eta(\dot{\gamma})=\frac{\tau}{du/dy}\label{apparent viscosity Non-newtonian}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
There are several rheological models, classified into Bingham plastic and
 pseudo-plastic (that have non-zero yield stress), shear-thinning and shear-thic
kening (that increase or decrease resistance with stronger shear) as can
 see in figure
\begin_inset space ~

 Each of the lines can be described by one of the theoretical models.
 For instance, a power law (or Ostwald) model, in a form of: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta=K\dot{\gamma}^{n-1}\label{eq:dynamic viscosity power-law}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where for Newtonian fluids 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 resulting in 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=K$

, shear-thinning fluids 
\begin_inset Formula $n<1$

, and shear-thickening fluids 
\begin_inset Formula $n>1$

microFlow in Channel

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Nominally, microchannels can be defined as channels whose dimensions are
 less than 1 millimeter and greater than 1 micron.Above 1 millimeter the
 flow exhibits behavior that is the same as most macroscopic flows.

 Fluids that are Newtonian at ordinary rates of shear and extension can
 become non-Newtonian at very high rates.
 The pressure gradient becomes especially large in small cross section channels.
 At any electrode immersed in an electrolyte solution Electrokinetic effects
 occur at the interface between liquids and solids such as glass due to
 chemical interaction.
 The result is an electrically charged double layer that induces a charge
 distribution in a very thin layer of fluid close to the wall.
 Application of an electric field to this layer creates a body force capable
 of moving the fluid as if it were slipping over the wall.
 It is important to aware that effects such the electroosmotic effect and
 the electrophoretic effect (charges around particles) are occuring at small
 scale.
 The electrical properties of such a layer are important, since they significant
ly affect the electrochemical measurements.
 The pressure drop in microchannel flow can be very large, and since all
 of the work of the pressure difference against the mean flow ultimately
 goes into viscous dissipation.
 Liquids in contact with solids have surface tension in the interface.
 At the microscale, the surface tension force becomes one of the most important
 forces, far exceeding body forces such as gravity and electrostatic fields.
 Slip boundery may exist due to the large shear forces apllied on the wall.
 Phenomenon of slip: Any flow situation where the tangential fluid velocity
 component appears to be different from that of the solid surface immediately
 in contact with it.

ERF contain at least two main components of a carrier fluid (solvent) and
 particles.
 Upon a strong electric field applied, particles connect to form a structure
 that look like a chain or a string.
 These connected particles create a stronger dipole and form micro solid
 structures inside the fluid.
 These formations change the viscosity of the fluid towards a more viscous
 state.
