Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Electrorheological fluids (ERF) are mixtures of active dipole particles
 and a dielectric fluid.
 The rheological properties of such substances, therefore, change when an
 external electrical field is applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rheology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Rheology branch or physics deals with deformation and flow of matter.
 Among others, it focus on the non-Newtonian flow of liquids, as well as,
 the plastic flow of solids.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align block
Rheological properties of interest in the context of ERF, are the shear
 stress (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

), shear rate or shear strain rate (
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\gamma}$
\end_inset

), dynamic viscosity (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

) and kinematic viscosity (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

).
 The relationship between the shear stress and the shear strain rate for
 liquids, in simple Newtonian fluid cases turns to be only their viscosity

The

 (

 Shear stress arises from the force vector component

\begin_inset Formula $A)$

 is the time differential.
 The 
\series bold
dynamic viscosity
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

) is the fluid property that relates shearing stress and fluid motion.
 For 
\shape italic
Newtonian fluids

, the dynamic viscosity is constant and named as
\series bold
 absolute viscosity
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta=\frac{\tau}{\dot{\gamma}}=\frac{\tau}{du/dy}=const.\label{dynamic viscosity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the 
\series bold
kinematic viscosity
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\nu=\frac{\eta}{\rho}\label{kinematic viscosity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the density of the liquid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
If the viscosity is influenced by the shear rate it is important to emphasize,
 that the values are different from the constant ones related to an ideally
 viscous fluid.
 The values obtained are apparent viscosity values.
 They represent one point of the viscosity function only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
For non-Newtonian fluids the shearing stress is not linearly related to
 the rate of shearing strain.
 For simplicity an

 The emergence of microfluidics with its wall-dominated flows raises the
 neccity to deal with slip boundary condition.
 The concept of a slip boundary condition was first proposed by Navier (1823).
 Navier slip boundary condition assumes constant slip length.
 In Navier’s model, the magnitude of the slip velocity,

 fluid at the wall, as reviewed by

Any electrode surface immersed in an electrolyte solution induces the Electrokin

 It take place at the interface between liquids and solids, such as glass,

 This double layer is similar to the one created at the surface of particles
 in liquid suspensions.
 The electrical properties of such a layer are important, since they significant
ly affect the electrochemical parameters.
 Application of an electric field to this layer creates a body force capable
 of moving the fluid as if it were slipping over a wall surface.
 Generally, Slip boundary effect may exist in cases such as the one described
 before, where the large shear forces are applied at the wall interface.
 This Phenomenon of slip boundary occurs in any flow situation where the
 tangential fluid velocity component appears to be different from that of
 the solid surface immediately in contact with it

The ERF are composed of at least two main components: a carrier fluid (solvent)
 and suspended particles.
 Upon application of a strong electric field, the suspended particles connect
 to form a structure resembling a chain or a string.
 These connected particles create a stronger dipole and form micro solid
 structures inside the fluid.
 These formations change the viscosity of the fluid towards a more viscous
 state.

 In other case when the fluid is invisible the fluid should be seeded.

 source place opposite to the camera and see the shadows of the particles.
 In this technique the particles we assume the particles have the same dynamic
 properties as the carrier fluid, and the particles are at size and color
 that make them visible to the camera.
 The other way is seeding The other is seeding.
